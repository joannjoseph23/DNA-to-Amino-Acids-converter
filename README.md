DNA to Amino Acid Converter
Description
This Java program converts a user-input DNA sequence into its corresponding mRNA sequence and then translates it into amino acids using codons. The program generates all possible codon permutations and combinations and maps them to amino acids based on standard genetic code.

Features
Accepts a DNA sequence from the user.

Converts DNA to mRNA using base-pair transcription rules.

Identifies codons from the mRNA sequence.

Maps codons to their respective amino acids.

Detects invalid DNA bases and codons.
